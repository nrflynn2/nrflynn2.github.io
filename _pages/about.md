Hello! I'm Noah, a research scientist within Amazon working on non-English language expansion for Alexa. I recently defended my [thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/59a7e3ff01e444dd0b5199f26d96c10a/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) and earned my PhD in Computational Biology at [Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis](https://medicine.wustl.edu/).
I focused on applications of machine learning to problems in drug discovery and toxicology and my work was supervised by Dr. Joshua Swamidass in the [Department of Pathology & Immunology](https://pathology.wustl.edu/).
In particular, my work involved modeling drug metabolism networks to guide development in early stage prediction of drug toxicity, formation of reactive chemical species, and likelihood of adverse drug reactions.
As part of my research, I also serve as a core maintainer of [XenoSite](https://swami.wustl.edu/xenosite/) and I launched the [XenoNet Web Server](https://swami.wustl.edu/xenonet/).
XenoSite is a prediction web service for small molecule biochemistry that hosts an online collection of metabolism and reactivity mathematical models that systematically summarize the data from thousands of papers into a condensed and useable computational tool that predicts adduction and potential toxicity of molecules.

I am an engineer by training and received my B.S. in the [Bioengineering](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/) program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Prior to switching to a heavier emphasis on computer science-related study, I spent time as a nomad across several scientific domains.
