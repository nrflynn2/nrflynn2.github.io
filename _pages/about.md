Hello! I'm Noah, a PhD candidate studying computational sciences at [Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis](https://medicine.wustl.edu/).
I focus on applications of machine learning to problems in drug discovery and toxicology and my work is supervised by Dr. Joshua Swamidass in the [Department of Pathology & Immunology](https://pathology.wustl.edu/).
In particular, my work involves modeling drug metabolism networks to guide development in early stage prediction of drug toxicity, formation of reactive chemical species, and likelihood of adverse drug reactions.
As a part of my research, I also serve as a core maintainer of [XenoSite](https://swami.wustl.edu/xenosite/).
XenoSite is a prediction web service for small molecule biochemistry that hosts an online collection of metabolism and reactivity mathematical models that systematically summarize the data from thousands of papers into a condensed and useable computational tool that predicts adduction and potential toxicity of molecules.

Recently, I just launched the [XenoNet Web Server](https://swami.wustl.edu/xenonet/). More information to follow soon!

I am an engineer by training and received my B.S. in the [Bioengineering](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/) program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Prior to switching to a heavier emphasis on computer science-related study, I spent time as a nomad across several scientific domains.
